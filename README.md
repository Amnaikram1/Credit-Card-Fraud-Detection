## Introduction
This dataset comprises credit card transactions designed for fraud detection purposes.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
```

## Usage
Load the dataset using the `pd.read_csv` module of the pandas library.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
The dataset contains 219,129 observations. 'IsFraud' has 150,000 non-null entries for the training set.

## Feature Utility Scores
- **Mutual Information Scores**
- **Correlation Coefficient**:
- | Correlation | Features   |
- ----------------------------
- | Positive    |   feat3, feat8 |
- | Negative     |  feat4, feat11, feat28 |


## Drop Columns
Dropped features: 'Time', 'feat2', 'feat6', 'feat13', 'feat25', 'feat27'.

## Feature Engineering
- **Binning**: Categorized transaction amounts into three intervals.
- **Transaction Amount to Mean Ratio**
- **Difference from Mean**
- **Logarithmic Transformation**
- **Standard Scaling**

## Model
Holdout validation was used. Random undersampling addressed class imbalance.
